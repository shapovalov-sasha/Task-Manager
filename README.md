# Task Mangager

Learn React by implementing a Task Manager app alongside with your Frontend mentor as a part of **React** course from [SkillBrain©](https://skillbrain.com/)

# How to

Clone this repository in the desired folder:

`git clone git@github.com:shapovalov-sasha/Task-Manager.git`

Navigate into project directory:

`cd Task-Manager`

Install by running:

`npm install`

When installation is done, start the project in development mode:

`npm start`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
